The first two lines ask the use to enter a DNA sequence and then a pattern.
The fourth line reverses the pattern in order to search for the backwards pattern later down the line.
The fifth and sixth lines find where the patterns exists in the sequence.
The eighth line (x) contains the begining of the sequence to the end of the first pattern.
The ninth line (y) contains the sequence in between the two patterns.
The tenth line (z) contains the sequence from the end of the second pattern to the end of the sequence.
The eleventh line reverses y, and then the twelth prints the mutated sequence.
